A repo where I worked through [Brad Traversy's](https://www.udemy.com/object-oriented-php-mvc/learn/v4/overview) PHP MVC course on Udemy.

As such, none of the coding here is original to me, nor will any of it work if
merely forked, as there are some URLs hardcoded into /public/.htaccess and in
app/config/config.php. The database information there pertains only to the
development environment using my local server.
